**Aisha** is a scalable search and retrieval tool with connection to custom internal data. This is as if giving the AI chat, like ChatGPT, Bard and LLAMA 2, additional knowledge to the internal data you have. Aisha does all of this, while keeping your data private and secured.
This method is also widely known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Aisha for product recommendation** is one offering of ours, which lets stores and product owners to allow customers browse the products catalogue in an interactive manner. Think of it as the best blend of a knowledge advisor and a product recommendation sales tool.

Principally, Aisha can be used for any kind of data you have (Confluence, repository, documents, pdfs, etc), with any cloud provider you like. Aka, it is fully customizable to your need!
