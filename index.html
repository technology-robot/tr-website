## 🏷 Our sample product(s)

{% include banner id="banner_aisha" type="center" %}

**Aisha** is a search and retrieval tool with connection to custom internal data. This is as if giving the AI chat, like ChatGPT, Bard and LLAMA 2, additional knowledge to the internal data you have. Aisha does all of this, while keeping your data private and secured.
This method is also widely known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Aisha for code** is the one we publish, with the hope to help developers code easier and faster when using any repository they like.
As it is free version, we use a less powerful AI to develop it.

Principally, Aisha can be used for any kind of data you have (Confluence, repository, documents, pdfs, etc), with any cloud provider you like. Aka, it is fully customizable to your need!
To upgrade and embed Aisha to your internal company's system, please feel free to book a meeting with us [here](/#booking-google-calendar)
