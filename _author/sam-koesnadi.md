# Motivation

I believe in a harmonious integration between human life and technology. Technology should be created with a single purpose of making humans life better. Technology is basically automating the intelligence of humans. There are thoughts needed to build something. This thought manifests as a product.

# Achievements

All noteworthy achievements are listed on my LinkedIn. Otherwise, I am a thoughtful person, and always experiments and try things out.
