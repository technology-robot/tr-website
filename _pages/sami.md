# Defining vision and mission

Vision is what to be, what to change, what to maintain. This remains forever. Mission, on the other hand, is the next step to accomplish according to the vision. The missions of the vision change as life goes. Once it is accomplished, the next missions can be designed.

The format of the section [List of visions](#list-of-visions) is as follows:

```
## {number}. {vision}

- {list of missions}
- ...
```

## The mentality in execution

The way to handle all the visions and missions is in accordance with the guideline of Islam. Of being truthful, being righteous and being brave to act. And also to share love with one another. However, do note that not everyone will be happy with what we do, so you do not have a goal to please them. The only person to please in this world, is Büsra.
