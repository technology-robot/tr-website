There are so many technical fields in this world that can be touched. Each has the potential to bring better life quality to humanity. All of them required specific intelligence to execute.

Bringing intelligence to humanity automatically improves quality of life, due to awareness on a better way to suit each indivual needs. This is historically done by introducing education to the people.

The aim to bring knowledge to the people is a job and purpose of its own. These people are everyone: the rich, the poor, etc.

Technology is advancing, so does increasing possible ways to introduce education. Advancing technology by its own also advances the vision "intelligence for all".

Spreading intelligence has to be done in accordance to bring good to the people. In other words, intelligence is aimed to help others and not to destroy.
