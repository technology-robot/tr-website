Technology Robot (TR) is a lifelong project. After years of gathering expertise, Sam Koesnadi, the founder, finds it is best to dedicate his time and energy into helping companies to integrate the latest state-of-the-art technology known at the time. As of 2023, he has expertise in AI, cloud computing, and software development ready to be used for various businesses' use-cases.

## Motivation

Sam's journey took a significant turn when he joined ML6, an AI and Cloud-based consultancy company in Berlin. Here, Sam wasn't just another engineer; he was a vital part of a team that was shaping the future of AI applications in the business world. His experiences at ML6 weren't just about honing his skills; they were about understanding the real-world impact of technology.

The quest for innovation led Sam to Bosch, a leader in technological advancement. As an MLOps Engineer in the Automated Driving domain, he found himself at the cutting edge of one of the most exciting and challenging areas of modern engineering. At Bosch, Sam's role was more than just a job; it was a front-row seat to the future of automation and AI.

However, it was not just his professional experiences that defined Sam's journey. Throughout his career, Sam realized a crucial gap between technological advancements and their practical application in businesses. This realization sparked an idea, a vision for a platform that would bridge this gap â€“ and thus, Technology Robot was born.

Technology Robot represents the start of a new chapter. It's not just a company; it's a mission to democratize the power of technology for businesses. With Technology Robot, Sam aims to provide tailored solutions that leverage AI, cloud computing, and software development to address unique business challenges.

In its early stages, Technology Robot is a beacon of potential. It stands for the possibilities that emerge when technology is aligned with business needs. Sam, at the helm, is not just an entrepreneur; he's a technologist with a purpose, a visionary who believes in the power of technology to transform businesses.

As Technology Robot embarks on its journey, the road ahead is filled with opportunities and challenges. But with Sam's unwavering commitment to innovation and problem-solving, the future looks promising. The story of Technology Robot is just beginning, and it's a tale of ambition, transformation, and the relentless pursuit of technological excellence.

## Technology Robot's mindset

Sam's story is not one of overnight success or serendipitous breakthroughs. It is a narrative of persistent curiosity, evolving expertise, and a vision to make a tangible difference in the world of technology and business. This is, although sounds cheesy, the genesis of Technology Robot. His fascination with technology began not as a whimsical interest, but as a deep-seated desire to understand how things work. This curiosity soon transformed into a dedicated pursuit of knowledge in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, software development and further more in the future. The will to always improve and act on it, is at its core of our mindset.
